# Machine Learning Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of **machine learning practice projects** built while learning and experimenting with different algorithms, datasets, and workflows. Each folder is a self-contained project with code, data (or data links), and notes.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `01_linear_regression/`
- `02_logistic_regression/`
- `03_classification/`
- `04_clustering/`
- `05_neural_networks/`
- `common_utils/` – shared helper functions (plots, metrics, preprocessing)
- `README.md` – overview of all projects (this file)

> Each project folder includes its own mini-README explaining the problem, dataset, and results. [web:115][web:118]

## 🧠 What these projects cover

- Supervised learning: regression (linear, multiple linear, regularized) and classification.
- Unsupervised learning: clustering, dimensionality reduction (if added later).
- End-to-end workflow: EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and basic interpretation. [web:112][web:110]

## 🛠 Tech stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, scikit-learn (and others per project)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code, Git, GitHub [web:117][web:116]

## 🚀 How to run the projects

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   cd <your-repo-name>
